# RC-self-driving-scale-car

<h3>This repository will document 3 different but related projects.</h3>

<b>Part 1:</b> The 3D printed OpenRC RC car <br>
  -A simple RC car everybody knows how to do <br>
  -Timeline: Finished by end of March
  
<b>Part 2:</b> A 3D printed RC car that is operated by a raspberry pi and has self-driving capabilities. <br>
  -Timeline: Finished by end of April. 

<b>Part 3:</b> A semi 3D printed RC car on a gokart frame that has much smarter self-driving capabilities than project 2. <br> 
  -Timeline: TBA
